<p>The Stella project always welcomes new developers, either on a full-time basis
or just to fix your favorite bug.  Feel free to	email
<a href="mailto:sa666666@gmail.com">Stephen Anthony</a> if you wish to contribute in any
way to the Stella project.</p>

<p>The first major hurdle for new developers is setting up a build environment, checking
out the code, and in general actually compiling the project for the first time.  The
following is a description of how to do this for the three major platforms.

<h3><u>Linux/UNIX</u></h3>
<ol>

  <li><p>Getting the required tools:
  <p>Stella needs g++ 4.8 or Clang++ 3.5 (with up-to-date C++11 support), make and
  <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">SDL2</a> development libraries installed.
  ZLib and PNG libraries are optional; Stella will use built-in versions if none
  are installed system-wide. These packages are likely available through your distribution
  repository. Consult your specific distribution for an explanation of installing new packages.
  <p>Other packages may be needed depending on the distribution you use.  The best thing
  to do is try the compile, note any missing packages, and then install them through your
  distribution repository.

  <br/>

  <li><p>Downloading the source code:
  <p>The source for the latest release can always be found under "Stable Releases" on the
  main webpage.  However, you'd be better off working with the most recent code, located
  in the <a href="https://github.com/stella-emu/stella">GitHub repository</a>.  The following
  command will <I>checkout</I> this code:
  <div class="con">git clone https://github.com/stella-emu/stella.git</div>
  <p>This will checkout from the <i>master branch</i> for local modifications. Please see below
  for instructions on how to contribute changes back to Stella.
  
  <p><B>Note: </B>You may be more familiar with graphical Git clients; these will work fine as well.
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li><p>Compiling the source code:
  <p><ol>
    <li>Generic build &mdash; When testing changes or creating personal builds, it's best to use
      the generic configure/make cycle:
    <p><div class="con">cd 'location of stella source code'
./configure (--help for list of options)
make
make install (if you want to install locally)</div>
    </li>

    <li><p>Debian-based distributions:
    <p><div class="con">cd 'location of stella source code'
dpkg-buildpackage</div>
    </li>

    <li><p>RPM-based distributions:
    <p><div class="con">cd 'location of stella source code'/src/unix
rpmbuild -ba stella.spec</div>
    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  
  <br/>

  <li><p>Contributing</p>
  <p>
  If you'd like to contribute to Stella, create a fork of the repository on github
  and make your changes there. After you are done, place a <i>pull request</i> against the
  Stella repository. This process is described in detail in the
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">github docs</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you do not want to create a github account, you can also create a diff of your
  changes using 
  <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem" class="con">git diff</div>
  and send it to the email address above. Please check out the
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">git documentation</a> on how
  to select particular commits for diffing.
  </p>

  <p>Before you start modifying code, it's best to <I>update</I> your local copy of the source code (so
  that you can see changes that others have made).  To do this, use the following command:
  <div class="con">git pull</div>
  </p>

</ol>

<br/>
<h3><u>Macintosh OSX</u></h3>
<ol>

  <li><p>Getting the required tools:
  <p>Stella needs Xcode 5/6 for compilation.  You will also need the SDL2 development libraries,
  located at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">libsdl.org</a>.  You will need
  to download <B>SDL2-2.0.4.dmg</B> (or newer, if available).

  <br/>

  <li><p>Downloading the source code:
  <p>The source for the latest release can always be found under "Stable Releases" on the
  main webpage.  However, you'd be better off working with the most recent code, located
  in the <a href="https://github.com/stella-emu/stella">GitHub repository</a>.  The following
  command will <I>checkout</I> this code:
  <div class="con">git clone https://github.com/stella-emu/stella.git</div>
  <p>This will checkout from the <i>master branch</i> for local modifications. Please see below
  for instructions on how to contribute changes back to Stella.

  <p><B>Note: </B>You may be more familiar with graphical Git clients; these will work fine as well.
  </li>

  <br/>

  <li><p>Compiling the source code:
  <p><ol>
    <li>The Xcode project is located at <I>src/macosx/stella.xcodeproj</I> and is for 64-bit Intel-only
    machines running 10.7 or greater.  There is currently no support for older OSX versions or for PPC builds.
    </li>

    <li><p>Place the <I>SDL.framework</I> bundle (located in the <B>SDL2-2.0.4.dmg</B> file
    you downloaded earlier) into the <I>/Library/Frameworks</I> directory.
    </li>

    <li><p>Open the project file using Xcode 5/6.</li>

    <li><p>Build the project by pressing Cmd-b, and run by pressing Cmd-r.</li>

    <li><p><B>Optional:</B> creating a DMG for release:
    <p><div class="con">cd 'location of stella source code'/src/macosx
./Create_build.sh 'version #'</div>
    <p>This will create a DMG installation archive on your desktop.
    <p>The Stella.app bundle can be copied to your <I>Applications</I> folder, or wherever you
    like on your system.
    </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

  <li><p>Contributing</p>
  <p>
  If you'd like to contribute to Stella, create a fork of the repository on github
  and make your changes there. After you are done, place a <i>pull request</i> against the
  Stella repository. This process is described in detail in the
  <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">github docs</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you do not want to create a github account, you can also create a diff of your
  changes using 
  <div style="margin-bottom: 1rem" class="con">git diff</div>
  and send it to the email address above. Please check out the

  <div class="con">git pull</div>
  </p>

</ol>

<br/>
<h3><u>Windows 7/8/10</u></h3>
<ol>

  <li><p>Getting the required tools:
  <p>Stella needs Visual Studio C++ 2015.  You will also need the SDL2 development libraries,
  located at <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php">libsdl.org</a>.
  <p>You will also need a Git client; the following assumes you are using <a href="https://tortoisegit.org">
  TortoiseGit</a>.

  <br/>

  <li><p>Downloading the source code:
  <p>The source for the latest release can always be found under "Stable Releases" on the
  main webpage.  However, you'd be better off working with the most recent code, located
  in the <a href="https://github.com/stella-emu/stella">GitHub repository</a>.  To <I>checkout</I>
  this code, you will need to install TortoiseGit, which you downloaded above.
  <p>Once TortoiseGit is installed, you should right-click somewhere in Windows Explorer where
  you wish to download the files, right-click and select <B>Git Clone...</B>  This will produce a window as follows:
  <p><blockquote><img src="images/git_clone.png"/></blockquote>
  <p>The <I>URL of repository</I> must be the same, but the <I>Checkout directory</I> will be
  specific to your system.
  <p>This will checkout from the <i>master branch</i> for local modifications.
  Please see below for instructions on how to contribute changes back to Stella.
  </li>

  <li><p>Compiling the source code:
  <p>Before compiling the code for the first time, Visual Studio must be set up as follows:
  <ol>
    <li><p>Open the Visual Studio 2015 project, located in REPO_DIR\src\windows, as in the following:
      <p><blockquote><img src="images/vs_open.png"/></blockquote>
    <li><p>Unzip the <B>SDL2-devel-2.0.4-VC.zip</B> file you downloaded above somewhere on your system.
      Make note of where these files are located.
    <li><p>Go to "PROJECT -> Stella Properties" menu (or click Alt-F7); this will create a window
      as follows: <p><blockquote><img src="images/vs_props.png"/></blockquote>
    <li><p>Notice the bolded text <B>"C:\Users\stephen\Source\sdl\include"</B> and
      <B>"C:\Users\stephen\Source\sdl\lib\x64"</B>?  You will need to add locations specific to your
      system which points to the SDL files.  These locations are to directories within the
      SDL2 zip archive, which you unzipped earlier.
    <li><p>For building and running the 32-bit version you need the path to point at <B>lib\x86</B> in
      <u>both</u> the <I>Debug</I> and <I>Release</I> versions.
    <li><p>For building and running the 64-bit version you need the path to point at <B>lib\x64</B> in
      <u>both</u> the <I>Debug</I> and <I>Release</I> versions.
    <li><p>Build the project; it should run to completion, perhaps with some warnings.
    <li><p>If you try to run at this point, it will probably complain that it can't find
      SDL2.dll.  Manually copy this file from SDL2 zip archive to one of the following locations:
      <blockquote><pre>
For the 32-bit version, you have to copy <B>lib\x86\SDL2.dll</B> into the <I>Release</I> and <I>Debug</I> folders.
For the 64-bit version, you have to copy <B>lib\x64\SDL2.dll</B> into the <I>x64\Release</I> and <I>x64\Debug</I> folders.
</pre></blockquote>
    <li>You may also get an error that the libraries <B>msvcp140.dll</B> and/or <B>msvcr140.dll</B> are not available.
      If so, you will need to download them from
      <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=48145">Visual C++ Redistributable Packages for Visual Studio 2015</a>
    </li>
