      <h2>Stella is DonationWare!</h2>

      <p>As of release 3.5, Stella is officially <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donationware">DonationWare.</a>
      What is DonationWare, you may ask?  Simply put, the concept of
donationware is
      where the developer requests donations that indicate appreciation for the
project,
      and as an incentive to continue work on the project.</p>

      <p>So who am I?  My name is <a href="http://minbar.org">Stephen
Anthony</a>, and
      I've maintained Stella exclusively for
      the last few years.  While I did have help many years ago (and owe a huge
debt to
      Brad Mott, original Stella creator), I've been working on the project
alone for
      quite some time.  I've personally added over tens of thousands of lines of code to
Stella, and
      coordinated several large merges from other projects (ScummVM for parts of
the GUI,
      Distella for the debugger disassembler, etc).  I've also created the
<b>Harmony
      Programming Tool</b> software for the <a
href="http://harmony.atariage.com">Harmony
      Cartridge</a>, and a version of the <a
href="http://www.arminvogl.de/KrokodileCartridge">KrokCom</a>
      software for Linux/macOS - <a href="http://krokcom.sourceforge.net">KrokCom
for UNIX</a>.
      So as you can see, I'm quite prolific in Atari 2600 development.</p>

      <p>Let me say up-front that donating is completely voluntary.  Stella is
an open-source /
      free software project, and will remain so because of its license (GPLv/2).
 It's
      not my intent to guilt anyone into donations, or to threaten that the
project will
      be discontinued if I don't receive any.  Donations are simply a way for
appreciative
      end-users to demonstrate their enjoyment of Stella, and to make me feel a
little
      better about the long hours spent on this project.</p>

      <p>I'll list a few reasons why you might want to make a donation:
      <ul>
        <li>I've been involved with this project since 2001; I can't even
begin
        to estimate how much time I've invested in this project, but it is
<b>easily</b>
        in the 1000's of hours, probably approaching 10000 by now!</li>
        <li>My number one goal for Stella is cross-platform compatibility; if at
        all possible, nobody will be left behind</li>
        <li>Stella is the oldest Atari 2600 emulator still under
active development</li>
        <li>One of the main goals of Stella is to help homebrew developers; as
such, Stella
        contains an actively developed <a href="docs/debugger.html">built-in
debugger</a>
        that IMHO is <b>unrivaled</b></li>
        <li>You're a homebrew developer who feels that Stella has helped greatly
in your
        development efforts</li>
        <li>If you just want to fire it up and play a game, the process is as
plug and play
        as possible</li>
        <li>To see your name in print in the <a href="credits.html">Credits
List</a> :)</li>
      </ul></p>

      <p>What type of donations would I consider?  I'm firmly of the opinion
that <i>beggars
      can't be choosers</i>.  That being said, I'm listing some of the things
I'd like
      to receive (in no particular order):
      <ul>
        <li>Esoteric controllers, such as a MindLink, KidVid, NTSC CompuMate, etc.</li>
        <li>For appreciative homebrew developers, a copy of your released
cart</li>
        <li>2600 carts, particularly those of rarer vintage, or in any case with
manuals
        and/or boxes</li>
        <li>Magazines or books on 2600-related stuff, or retro stuff in general</li>
        <li>2600 consoles (heavy-sixer, light-sixer, Vader, Jr, etc.)</li>
        <li>Anything 7800 related; I'm beginning to get into the 7800 scene, and
have
        just the console and a few games at this point</li>
        <li>Games gifted to me on Steam (let me know beforehand, to make sure I don't
            already have it</li>
        <li>Anything else retro-related that you think is cool</li>
        <li>Cash donations</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>Note that I've ranked money at the bottom of the list.  This isn't a
mistake.
      While I appreciate any monetary donations I might receive, I'm not in this
for the money.
      If I was, I would have abandoned the project after the first year. :)
That being
      said, any monetary contributions I do receive will be used to purchase
extra hardware,
      carts, etc for testing.</p>

      <p>If you're interested in making a Paypal donation, my Paypal address is
      <a href="mailto:sa666666@gmail.com">sa666666@gmail.com</a>.  If using
Paypal, please
      mark the contribution as a <b>gift</b> to save fees on my end (under "Send
Money", select 'Personal', then 'Gift').
      Otherwise, if you have something to ship, please contact me at the same
address for shipping
      details.  Note that I'm located in Canada, so your location in the world
might cause some
      shipping issues.  Also, let me know how you'd like to be credited in the
<a href="credits.html">Credits List</a>
      (real name or a nickname, your personal webpage, other info about
yourself, etc).  Finally, please mark all donations as a <b>gift valued at $20 or less</b>;
this will reduce customs charges on my end.</p>

      <h3>Thanks in advance for any donations I may receive, and for all past
donations.
      Let's help keep the Atari 2600 emulation scene alive.</h3>
